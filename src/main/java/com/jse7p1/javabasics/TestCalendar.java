       e) Aim to write about 5 questions/programs for each of the topics I have set below.
       f) For names. I suggest you use names of classes, methods, variables that are normally used such as from the below list
            {Company,Employee,Employer} {Car,Manufacturer,Driver} {House,Room,Door} ..etc dont use any specific names of persons etc.
       g) You should also make questions that dont have code and test specific knowledge of the topic but no more than 2 per topic and should test important aspect of the question. These should be in addition to 5 code related questions.
